# May 23 - Idea
Let's try this again.

Today I got the inspiration to make a tiny e-book reader and planned out a rough roadmap for how I want this project to go. I'm making this alongside exams so I'll probably complete it over multiple days in small sessions.

The PCB shouldn't be too complex. It'll use an RP2040-based microcontroller because of the amazing documentation, probably a Pico or smaller to keep the PCB small. Maybe a SEEED XIAO if I don't use all the Pico's GPIO pins. Obviously I need an e-ink screen to read e-books. Right now I think there should be two buttons for scrolling and two for selecting a book. If possible I should make it battery-powered.

Ideally I shouldn't need a case but I'll design one anyway to develop my CAD skills. I might not be able to get it printed but that's another problem.

A while ago I created a Python program to read text and markdown files so I'll be building on that for my firmware.

(no pictures today, all in my head for now)

Today I just made the repo, planned out my idea and wrote up this journal post. All this took much longer than expected, because I made a few revisions to the idea before I wrote it up. Next time I'll start making the PCB! I also need to start writing the README, but I'll make the PCB first.

**Time spent this session: 1hrs**
